Status: not promoted

Area: ImageWAM on Thor — precision and real-weight path

## Observation

`plan.md`'s current plan uses randomly initialized weights and a
BF16-only forward, deferring FP8 quantization, calibration, real
checkpoint loading, and accuracy validation. ImageWAM's FLUX.2-4B
variant needs roughly 18GB of weights in bf16 (backbone + Qwen3-4B
text encoder + VAE) before activation memory.

## Opportunity

Once the plan's phases produce a working structural forward pass,
extend it to: load the real released checkpoint
(`yuyangalin/ImageWAM-FLUX.2-4B-LIBERO`), add FP8 quantization and
calibration following FlashRT's existing house calibration mechanism
(`docs/calibration.md`), and validate cosine similarity against the
PyTorch reference implementation.

## Expected Mechanism

Same mechanism already used by every other FlashRT Thor model: static
per-tensor/rowwise scales from a calibration forward pass, FP8 GEMMs
in the production forward, a BF16 calibration twin retained for
recalibration.

## Required Evidence

The structural plan (`plan.md`) must complete first: a real weight
loader is meaningless without the pipeline forward and CUDA Graph
capture already working, and calibration is meaningless without real
weights to calibrate.

## Promotion Condition

Promote to a plan once real ImageWAM weights are available on the
target machine and the current structural plan's phases are complete.
